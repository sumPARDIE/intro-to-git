Too Much Isn't Enough

Nowadays it feels as though too much isn't enough. This goes for almost anyone I seem to come across lately. 
It is starting to make me ask the question, is there EVER enough? Is this an issue with mankind as a whole?
It is clearly becoming an issue. If not, it's always been an issue. This concept of "enough" is interesting 
all on it's own. The idea is that we as humans have a hunger for life, and that its a hunger that can be satisfied.
Its a natural hunger that is entirely subjective to each individual and is intrinsicly a part of our well-being.
